# Radiant Music

Radiant Music is a frontend e-commerce application for all things music related. It was built using React and custom CSS.

Radiant Music is the culmination of our 2nd phase in Flatiron School's Software Engineering program. You can learn more about us below.

## Launch

To run Radiant Music locally, you'll need to use json-server.

If you don't already have json-server installed, you can install it by running `npm install -g json-server`.

Then, run `json-server watch --db.json --port 4000` to mimic API functionality.

Note: the current setup is configured to work with port 4000 specifically. Running your json-server on a different port will cause an error.
