# Radiant Music

Radiant Music is a frontend e-commerce application for all things music related. It was built using React and custom CSS.

Radiant Music is the culmination of our 2nd phase in Flatiron School's <a href="https://flatironschool.com/courses/coding-bootcamp/">Software Engineering</a> program. You can learn more about us below.

## Launch

To run Radiant Music locally, you'll need to use json-server.

If you don't already have json-server installed, you can install it by running `npm install -g json-server`.

Then, navigate to the "Data" directory within the "src" directory and run `json-server watch --db.json --port 4000` to mimic API functionality.

Note: the current setup is configured to work with port 4000 specifically. Running your json-server on a different port will cause an error.

Once you've started your json-server, you can run `npm start` within the "phase-2-project" directory to launch the React app.
